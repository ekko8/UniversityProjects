# UniversityProjects
This repo includes many of the projects I completed during my time at the University of Missouri

# Projects included
1. status.sh - Uses the systemctl command to check the status of any daemon. Also allows starting and stopping of the daemon.
2.  InternationalSoccerAnalyzer - Uses a bash script to analyze [csv files](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017) containing information about every International Soccer Game recorded since 1872. It uses 2 simple python scripts to save every country that has competed, and every city that has hosted a match to their own csv files for use in the bash script.
